"Collects the names of all the source files in the specified directory and"
" stores the list in the ``<variable>`` provided.  This command is "
"intended to be used by projects that use explicit template instantiation."
"  Template instantiation files can be stored in a ``Templates`` "
"subdirectory and collected automatically using this command to avoid "
"manually listing all instantiations."

"It is tempting to use this command to avoid writing the list of source "
"files for a library or executable target.  While this seems to work, "
"there is no way for CMake to generate a build system that knows when a "
"new source file has been added.  Normally the generated build system "
"knows when it needs to rerun CMake because the ``CMakeLists.txt`` file is"
" modified to add a new source.  When the source is just added to the "
"directory without modifying this file, one would have to manually rerun "
"CMake to generate a build system incorporating the new file."
