"Defines one property in a scope for use with the :command:`set_property` "
"and :command:`get_property` commands.  This is primarily useful to "
"associate documentation with property names that may be retrieved with "
"the :command:`get_property` command. The first argument determines the "
"kind of scope in which the property should be used.  It must be one of "
"the following:"

"Note that unlike :command:`set_property` and :command:`get_property` no "
"actual scope needs to be given; only the kind of scope is important."

"The required ``PROPERTY`` option is immediately followed by the name of "
"the property being defined."

"If the ``INHERITED`` option is given, then the :command:`get_property` "

"property is not set in the scope given to the command."

"``DIRECTORY`` scope chains to its parent directory's scope, continuing "
"the walk up parent directories until a directory has the property set or "
"there are no more parents.  If still not found at the top level "
"directory, it chains to the ``GLOBAL`` scope."

"``TARGET``, ``SOURCE`` and ``TEST`` properties chain to ``DIRECTORY`` "
"scope, including further chaining up the directories, etc. as needed."

#: ../../CMake/Help/command/define_property.rst:48
msgid ""
"Note that this scope chaining behavior only applies to calls to "
":command:`get_property`, :command:`get_directory_property`, "
":command:`get_target_property`, :command:`get_source_file_property` and "
":command:`get_test_property`.  There is no inheriting behavior when "
"*setting* properties, so using ``APPEND`` or ``APPEND_STRING`` with the "
":command:`set_property` command will not consider inherited values when "
"working out the contents to append to."

"The ``BRIEF_DOCS`` and ``FULL_DOCS`` options are followed by strings to "
"be associated with the property as its brief and full documentation. "
"Corresponding options to the :command:`get_property` command will "
"retrieve the documentation."
