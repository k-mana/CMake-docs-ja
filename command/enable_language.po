"Enables support for the named language in CMake.  This is the same as the"
" :command:`project` command but does not create any of the extra "
"variables that are created by the project command.  Example languages are"
" ``CXX``, ``C``, ``CUDA``, ``OBJC``, ``OBJCXX``, ``Fortran``, ``ISPC``, "
"and ``ASM``."

msgid ""
"This command must be called in file scope, not in a function call. "
"Furthermore, it must be called in the highest directory common to all "
"targets using the named language directly for compiling sources or "
"indirectly through link dependencies.  It is simplest to enable all "
"needed languages in the top-level directory of a project."

"The ``OPTIONAL`` keyword is a placeholder for future implementation and "
"does not currently work. Instead you can use the :module:`CheckLanguage` "
"module to verify support before enabling."
