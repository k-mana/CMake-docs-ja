"The executable is run in the optionally specified directory.  The "
"executable can include arguments if it is double quoted, but it is better"
" to use the optional ``ARGS`` argument to specify arguments to the "
"program.  This is because cmake will then be able to escape spaces in the"
" executable path.  An optional argument ``OUTPUT_VARIABLE`` specifies a "
"variable in which to store the output.  To capture the return value of "
"the execution, provide a ``RETURN_VALUE``.  If ``OUTPUT_VARIABLE`` is "
"specified, then no output will go to the stdout/stderr of the console "
"running cmake."
