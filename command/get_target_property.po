"Get a property from a target.  The value of the property is stored in the"
" variable ``<VAR>``.  If the target property is not found, the behavior "
"depends on whether it has been defined to be an ``INHERITED`` property or"
" not (see :command:`define_property`).  Non-inherited properties will set"
" ``<VAR>`` to ``<VAR>-NOTFOUND``, whereas inherited properties will "
"search the relevant parent scope as described for the "
":command:`define_property` command and if still unable to find the "
"property, ``<VAR>`` will be set to an empty string."

"Use :command:`set_target_properties` to set target property values. "
"Properties are usually used to control how a target is built, but some "
"query the target instead.  This command can get properties for any target"
" so far created.  The targets do not need to be in the current "
"``CMakeLists.txt`` file."
