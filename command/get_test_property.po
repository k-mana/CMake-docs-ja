"Get a property from the test.  The value of the property is stored in the"
" variable ``VAR``.  If the test property is not found, the behavior "
"depends on whether it has been defined to be an ``INHERITED`` property or"
" not (see :command:`define_property`).  Non-inherited properties will set"
" ``VAR`` to \"NOTFOUND\", whereas inherited properties will search the "
"relevant parent scope as described for the :command:`define_property` "
"command and if still unable to find the property, ``VAR`` will be set to "
"an empty string."
