"The list subcommands ``APPEND``, ``INSERT``, ``FILTER``, ``PREPEND``, "
"``POP_BACK``, ``POP_FRONT``, ``REMOVE_AT``, ``REMOVE_ITEM``, "
"``REMOVE_DUPLICATES``, ``REVERSE`` and ``SORT`` may create new values for"
" the list within the current CMake variable scope.  Similar to the "
":command:`set` command, the LIST command creates new variable values in "
"the current scope, even if the list itself is actually defined in a "
"parent scope.  To propagate the results of these operations upwards, use "
":command:`set` with ``PARENT_SCOPE``, :command:`set` with ``CACHE "
"INTERNAL``, or some other means of value propagation."

"A list in cmake is a ``;`` separated group of strings.  To create a list "
"the set command can be used.  For example, ``set(var a b c d e)`` creates"
" a list with ``a;b;c;d;e``, and ``set(var \"a b c d e\")`` creates a "
"string or a list with one item in it.   (Note macro arguments are not "
"variables, and therefore cannot be used in LIST commands.)"

"When specifying index values, if ``<element index>`` is 0 or greater, it "
"is indexed from the beginning of the list, with 0 representing the first "
"list element.  If ``<element index>`` is -1 or lesser, it is indexed from"
" the end of the list, with -1 representing the last list element. Be "
"careful when counting with negative indices: they do not start from 0.  "
"-0 is equivalent to 0, the first list element."
