"This command was originally added to support Qt 3 before the "
":command:`add_custom_command()` command was sufficiently mature.  The "
":module:`FindQt4` module provides the ``qt4_wrap_ui()`` macro, which "
"should be used instead for Qt 4 projects.  For projects using Qt 5 or "
"later, use the equivalent macro provided by Qt itself (e.g. Qt 5 provides"
" ``qt5_wrap_ui()``)."
