"Returns from a file, directory or function.  When this command is "
"encountered in an included file (via :command:`include` or "
":command:`find_package`), it causes processing of the current file to "
"stop and control is returned to the including file.  If it is encountered"
" in a file which is not included by another file, e.g.  a "
"``CMakeLists.txt``, deferred calls scheduled by "
":command:`cmake_language(DEFER)` are invoked and control is returned to "
"the parent directory if there is one.  If return is called in a function,"
" control is returned to the caller of the function."

"Note that a :command:`macro <macro>`, unlike a :command:`function "
"<function>`, is expanded in place and therefore cannot handle "
