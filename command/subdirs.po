"Add a list of subdirectories to the build.  The "
":command:`add_subdirectory` command should be used instead of ``subdirs``"
" although ``subdirs`` will still work.  This will cause any "
"CMakeLists.txt files in the sub directories to be processed by CMake.  "
"Any directories after the ``PREORDER`` flag are traversed first by "
"makefile builds, the ``PREORDER`` flag has no effect on IDE projects.  "
"Any directories after the ``EXCLUDE_FROM_ALL`` marker will not be "
"included in the top level makefile or project file.  This is useful for "
"having CMake create makefiles or projects for a set of examples in a "
"project.  You would want CMake to generate makefiles or project files for"
" all the examples at the same time, but you would not want them to show "
"up in the top level project or be built each time make is run from the "
"top."
