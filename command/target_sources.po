"The ``INTERFACE``, ``PUBLIC`` and ``PRIVATE`` keywords are required to "
"specify the scope of the items following them.  ``PRIVATE`` and "
"``PUBLIC`` items will populate the :prop_tgt:`SOURCES` property of "
"``<target>``, which are used when building the target itself. ``PUBLIC`` "
"and ``INTERFACE`` items will populate the :prop_tgt:`INTERFACE_SOURCES` "
"property of ``<target>``, which are used when building dependents. The "
"following arguments specify sources.  Repeated calls for the same "
"``<target>`` append items in the order called. The targets created by "
":command:`add_custom_target` can only have ``PRIVATE`` scope."
