"The first argument (``TEST_VARIABLE``) is the name of the variable to be "
"tested, if that variable is false nothing else is done.  If "
"``TEST_VARIABLE`` is true, then the next argument (``RESULT_VARIABLE``) "
"is a variable that is set to true if all the required variables are set. "
"The rest of the arguments are variables that must be true or not set to "
"``NOTFOUND`` to avoid an error.  If any are not true, an error is "
"reported."
