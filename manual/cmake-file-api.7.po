"CMake provides a file-based API that clients may use to get semantic "
"information about the buildsystems CMake generates.  Clients may use the "
"API by writing query files to a specific location in a build tree to "

"buildsystem in that build tree it will read the query files and write "
"reply files for the client to read."
