"Policies in CMake are used to preserve backward compatible behavior "
"across multiple releases.  When a new policy is introduced, newer CMake "
"versions will begin to warn about the backward compatible behavior.  It "
"is possible to disable the warning by explicitly requesting the OLD, or "
"backward compatible behavior using the :command:`cmake_policy` command. "
"It is also possible to request ``NEW``, or non-backward compatible "
"behavior for a policy, also avoiding the warning.  Each policy can also "
"be set to either ``NEW`` or ``OLD`` behavior explicitly on the command "
"line with the :variable:`CMAKE_POLICY_DEFAULT_CMP<NNNN>` variable."

"A policy is a deprecation mechanism and not a reliable feature toggle. A "
"policy should almost never be set to ``OLD``, except to silence warnings "
"in an otherwise frozen or stable codebase, or temporarily as part of a "
"larger migration path. The ``OLD`` behavior of each policy is undesirable"
" and will be replaced with an error condition in a future release."

"The :command:`cmake_minimum_required` command does more than report an "
"error if a too-old version of CMake is used to build a project.  It also "
"sets all policies introduced in that CMake version or earlier to ``NEW`` "
"behavior.  To manage policies without increasing the minimum required "
"CMake version, the :command:`if(POLICY)` command may be used:"

"This has the effect of using the ``NEW`` behavior with newer CMake "
"releases which users may be using and not issuing a compatibility "
"warning."

msgid ""
"The setting of a policy is confined in some cases to not propagate to the"
" parent scope.  For example, if the files read by the :command:`include` "
"command or the :command:`find_package` command contain a use of "
":command:`cmake_policy`, that policy setting will not affect the caller "
"by default.  Both commands accept an optional ``NO_POLICY_SCOPE`` keyword"
" to control this behavior."

"The :variable:`CMAKE_MINIMUM_REQUIRED_VERSION` variable may also be used "
"to determine whether to report an error on use of deprecated macros or "
"functions."
