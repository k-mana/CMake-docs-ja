"The ``cmake_add_fortran_subdirectory`` function adds a subdirectory to a "
"project that contains a fortran-only subproject.  The module will check "
"the current compiler and see if it can support fortran.  If no fortran "
"compiler is found and the compiler is MSVC, then this module will find "
"the MinGW gfortran.  It will then use an external project to build with "
"the MinGW tools.  It will also create imported targets for the libraries "
"created.  This will only work if the fortran code is built into a dll, so"
" :variable:`BUILD_SHARED_LIBS` is turned on in the project.  In addition "
"the :variable:`CMAKE_GNUtoMS` option is set to on, so that Microsoft "
"``.lib`` files are created.  Usage is as follows:"
