msgid ""
"Where ``<option>`` is available to the user if ``<depends>`` is true. "
"When ``<option>`` is available, the given ``<help_text>`` and initial "
"``<value>`` are used. If the ``<depends>`` condition is not true, "
"``<option>`` will not be presented and will always have the value given "
"by ``<force>``. Any value set by the user is preserved for when the "
"option is presented again. Each element in the fourth parameter is "
"evaluated as an if-condition, so :ref:`Condition Syntax` can be used."

msgid ""
"If ``USE_BAR`` is true and ``USE_ZOT`` is false, this provides an option "
"called ``USE_FOO`` that defaults to ON. Otherwise, it sets ``USE_FOO`` to"
" OFF and hides the option from the user. If the status of ``USE_BAR`` or "
"``USE_ZOT`` ever changes, any value for the ``USE_FOO`` option is saved "
"so that when the option is re-enabled it retains its old value."
