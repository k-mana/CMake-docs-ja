"This module was once needed to expand imported targets to the underlying "
"libraries they reference on disk for use with the :command:`try_compile` "
"and :command:`try_run` commands.  These commands now support imported "
"libraries in their ``LINK_LIBRARIES`` options (since CMake 2.8.11 for "

"CMAKE_EXPAND_IMPORTED_TARGETS() takes a list of libraries and replaces "
"all imported targets contained in this list with their actual file paths "
"of the referenced libraries on disk, including the libraries from their "
"link interfaces.  If a CONFIGURATION is given, it uses the respective "
"configuration of the imported targets if it exists.  If no CONFIGURATION "
"is given, it uses the first configuration from "
"${CMAKE_CONFIGURATION_TYPES} if set, otherwise ${CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE}."
