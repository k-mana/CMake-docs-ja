"This script is used to verify that embedded manifests and side by side "
"manifests for a project match.  To run this script, cd to a directory and"
" run the script with cmake -P.  On the command line you can pass in "
"versions that are OK even if not found in the .manifest files.  For "
"example, cmake -Dallow_versions=8.0.50608.0 -PCmakeVerifyManifest.cmake "
"could be used to allow an embedded manifest of 8.0.50608.0 to be used in "
"a project even if that version was not found in the .manifest file."
