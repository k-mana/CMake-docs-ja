"To use launchers, set CTEST_USE_LAUNCHERS to ON in a ctest -S dashboard "
"script, and then also set it in the cache of the configured project.  "
"Both cmake and ctest need to know the value of it for the launchers to "
"work properly.  CMake needs to know in order to generate proper build "
"rules, and ctest, in order to produce the proper error and warning "
"analysis."

"For convenience, you may set the ENV variable CTEST_USE_LAUNCHERS_DEFAULT"
" in your ctest -S script, too.  Then, as long as your CMakeLists uses "
"include(CTest) or include(CTestUseLaunchers), it will use the value of "
"the ENV variable to initialize a CTEST_USE_LAUNCHERS cache variable.  "
"This cache variable initialization only occurs if CTEST_USE_LAUNCHERS is "
"not already defined."
