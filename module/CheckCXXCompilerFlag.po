"This command temporarily sets the ``CMAKE_REQUIRED_DEFINITIONS`` variable"
" and calls the ``check_cxx_source_compiles`` macro from the "
":module:`CheckCXXSourceCompiles` module.  See documentation of that "
"module for a listing of variables that can otherwise modify the build."

"A positive result from this check indicates only that the compiler did "
"not issue a diagnostic message when given the flag.  Whether the flag has"
" any effect or even a specific one is beyond the scope of this module."

"Since the :command:`try_compile` command forwards flags from variables "
"like :variable:`CMAKE_CXX_FLAGS <CMAKE_<LANG>_FLAGS>`, unknown flags in "
"such variables may cause a false negative for this check."
