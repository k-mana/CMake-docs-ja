"where ``<lang>`` is a language that may be passed to "
":command:`enable_language` such as ``Fortran``.  If "
":variable:`CMAKE_<LANG>_COMPILER` is already defined the check does "
"nothing.  Otherwise it tries enabling the language in a test project.  "
"The result is cached in :variable:`CMAKE_<LANG>_COMPILER` as the compiler"
" that was found, or ``NOTFOUND`` if the language cannot be enabled. For "
"CUDA which can have an explicit host compiler, the cache "
":variable:`CMAKE_CUDA_HOST_COMPILER` variable will be set if it was "
"required for compilation (and cleared if it was not)."
