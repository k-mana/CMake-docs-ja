"This command temporarily sets the ``CMAKE_REQUIRED_LINK_OPTIONS`` "
"variable and calls the :command:`check_source_compiles` command from the "
":module:`CheckSourceCompiles` module.  See that module's documentation "
"for a listing of variables that can otherwise modify the build."

"The underlying implementation relies on the :prop_tgt:`LINK_OPTIONS` "
"property to check the specified flag. The ``LINKER:`` prefix, as "
"described in the :command:`target_link_options` command, can be used as "
"well."

"A positive result from this check indicates only that the compiler did "
"not issue a diagnostic message when given the link flag.  Whether the "
"flag has any effect or even a specific one is beyond the scope of this "
"module."

msgid ""
"Since the :command:`try_compile` command forwards flags from variables "
"like :variable:`CMAKE_<LANG>_FLAGS`, unknown flags in such variables may "
"cause a false negative for this check."
