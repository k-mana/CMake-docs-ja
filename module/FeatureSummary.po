"What type of dependency has the using project on that package. Default is"

"project when available at buildtime, but it also work without. "
"``RECOMMENDED`` is similar to ``OPTIONAL``, i.e.  the project will build "
"if the package is not present, but the functionality of the resulting "
"binaries will be severely limited.  If a ``REQUIRED`` package is not "
"available at buildtime, the project may not even build.  This can be "
"combined with the ``FATAL_ON_MISSING_REQUIRED_PACKAGES`` argument for "
"``feature_summary()``.  Last, a ``RUNTIME`` package is a package which is"
" actually not used at all during the build, but which is required for "
"actually running the resulting binaries.  So if such a package is "
"missing, the project can still be built, but it may not work later on. If"

"package with different TYPEs, the ``TYPE`` is only changed to higher "
