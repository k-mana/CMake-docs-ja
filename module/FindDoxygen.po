msgid ""
"This function is intended as a convenience for adding a target for "
"generating documentation with Doxygen. It aims to provide sensible "
"defaults so that projects can generally just provide the input files and "
"directories and that will be sufficient to give sensible results. The "
"function supports the ability to customize the Doxygen configuration used"
" to build the documentation."
msgstr ""

#: ../../CMake/Modules/FindDoxygen.cmake:81
msgid ""
"The function constructs a ``Doxyfile`` and defines a custom target that "
"runs Doxygen on that generated file. The listed files and directories are"
" used as the ``INPUT`` of the generated ``Doxyfile`` and they can contain"
" wildcards. Any files that are listed explicitly will also be added as "
"``SOURCES`` of the custom target so they will show up in an IDE project's"
" source list."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"So that relative input paths work as expected, by default the working "
"directory of the Doxygen command will be the current source directory "
"(i.e. :variable:`CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR`). This can be overridden with "
"the ``WORKING_DIRECTORY`` option to change the directory used as the "
"relative base point. Note also that Doxygen's default behavior is to "
"strip the working directory from relative paths in the generated "
"documentation (see the ``STRIP_FROM_PATH`` `Doxygen config option "
"<http://www.doxygen.org/manual/config.html>`_ for details)."

" will create a stamp file with the name ``<targetName>.stamp`` in the "
"current binary directory whenever doxygen is re-run.  With this option "
"present, all items in ``<filesOrDirs>`` must be files (i.e. no "
"directories, symlinks or wildcards) and each of the files must exist at "
"the time ``doxygen_add_docs()`` is called.  An error will be raised if "
"any of the items listed is missing or is not a file when "
"``USE_STAMP_FILE`` is given. A dependency will be created on each of the "
"files so that doxygen will only be re-run if one of the files is updated."

"directory within the source tree so that relative source paths work as "

"A number of Doxygen config options accept lists of values, but Doxygen "
"requires them to be separated by whitespace. CMake variables hold lists "
"as a string with items separated by semi-colons, so a conversion needs to"

msgid ""
"There are situations where it may be undesirable for a particular config "
"option to be automatically quoted by ``doxygen_add_docs()``, such as "
"``ALIASES`` which may need to include its own embedded quoting.  The "
"``DOXYGEN_VERBATIM_VARS`` variable can be used to specify a list of "
"Doxygen variables (including the leading ``DOXYGEN_`` prefix) which "
"should not be quoted.  The project is then responsible for ensuring that "
"those variables' values make sense when placed directly in the Doxygen "
"input file.  In the case of list variables, list items are still "
"separated by spaces, it is only the automatic quoting that is skipped.  "
"For example, the following allows ``doxygen_add_docs()`` to apply quoting"
" to ``DOXYGEN_PROJECT_BRIEF``, but not each item in the "
"``DOXYGEN_ALIASES`` list (:ref:`bracket syntax <Bracket Argument>` can "
"also be used to make working with embedded quotes easier):"
