"This function is intended to be used in FindXXX.cmake modules files. It "
"will print a message once for each unique find result.  This is useful "
"for telling the user where a package was found.  The first argument "
"specifies the name (XXX) of the package.  The second argument specifies "
"the message to display.  The third argument lists details about the find "
"result so that if they change the message will be displayed again.  The "
"macro also obeys the QUIET argument to the find_package command."
