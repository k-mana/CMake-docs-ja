"Each component is separate and you must opt in to each module.  You must "
"also opt into OpenGL (and OpenThreads?) as these modules won't do it for "
"you.  This is to allow you control over your own system piece by piece in"
" case you need to opt out of certain components or change the Find "
"behavior for a particular module (perhaps because the default "
"FindOpenGL.cmake module doesn't work with your system as an example). If "
"you want to use a more convenient module that includes everything, use "
"the FindOpenSceneGraph.cmake instead of the Findosg*.cmake modules."
