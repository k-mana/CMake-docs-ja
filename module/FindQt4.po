"This module can be used to find Qt4.  The most important issue is that "
"the Qt4 qmake is available via the system path.  This qmake is then used "

" executables. To disable that globally, set the ``QT4_NO_LINK_QTMAIN`` "
"variable before finding Qt4. To disable that for a particular executable,"
