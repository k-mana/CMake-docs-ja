"Created by Eric Wing.  This module is a bit more complicated than the "
"other FindSDL* family modules.  The reason is that SDL_sound can be "
"compiled in a large variety of different ways which are independent of "
"platform.  SDL_sound may dynamically link against other 3rd party "
"libraries to get additional codec support, such as Ogg Vorbis, SMPEG, "
"ModPlug, MikMod, FLAC, Speex, and potentially others.  Under some "
"circumstances which I don't fully understand, there seems to be a "
"requirement that dependent libraries of libraries you use must also be "
"explicitly linked against in order to successfully compile.  SDL_sound "
"does not currently have any system in place to know how it was compiled."
"  So this CMake module does the hard work in trying to discover which 3rd"
" party libraries are required for building (if any). This module uses a "
"brute force approach to create a test program that uses SDL_sound, and "
"then tries to build it.  If the build fails, it parses the error output "
"for known symbol names to figure out which libraries are needed."

"On OSX, this will prefer the Framework version (if found) over others. "
"People will have to manually change the cache values of SDL_LIBRARY to "
"override this selectionor set the CMake environment CMAKE_INCLUDE_PATH to"
" modify the search paths."
