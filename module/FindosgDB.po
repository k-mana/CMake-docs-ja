"This is part of the ``Findosg*`` suite used to find OpenSceneGraph "
"components.  Each component is separate and you must opt in to each "
"module.  You must also opt into OpenGL and OpenThreads (and Producer if "
"needed) as these modules won't do it for you.  This is to allow you "
"control over your own system piece by piece in case you need to opt out "
"of certain components or change the Find behavior for a particular module"
" (perhaps because the default :module:`FindOpenGL` module doesn't work "
"with your system as an example).  If you want to use a more convenient "
"module that includes everything, use the :module:`FindOpenSceneGraph` "
"instead of the ``Findosg*.cmake`` modules."
