"This is part of the Findosg* suite used to find OpenSceneGraph "
"components.  Each component is separate and you must opt in to each "
"module.  You must also opt into OpenGL and OpenThreads (and Producer if "
"needed) as these modules won't do it for you.  This is to allow you "
"control over your own system piece by piece in case you need to opt out "
"of certain components or change the Find behavior for a particular module"
" (perhaps because the default FindOpenGL.cmake module doesn't work with "
"your system as an example).  If you want to use a more convenient module "
"that includes everything, use the FindOpenSceneGraph.cmake instead of the"
" Findosg*.cmake modules."
