"This function is intended to offer an approximation of the value of the "
"number of compute cores available on the current machine, such that you "
"may use that value for parallel building and parallel testing.  It is "
"meant to help utilize as much of the machine as seems reasonable.  Of "
"course, knowledge of what else might be running on the machine "
"simultaneously should be used when deciding whether to request a "
"machine's full capacity all for yourself."
