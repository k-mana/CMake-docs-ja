"CMake requires that projects specify the version of CMake to which they "
"have been written.  This policy has been put in place so users trying to "
"build the project may be told when they need to update their CMake.  "
"Specifying a version also helps the project build with CMake versions "
"newer than that specified.  Use the :command:`cmake_minimum_required` "
"command at the top of your main ``CMakeLists.txt`` file:"

"where ``<major>.<minor>`` is the version of CMake you want to support "
"(such as ``3.14``).  The command will ensure that at least the given "
"version of CMake is running and help newer versions be compatible with "
"the project.  See documentation of :command:`cmake_minimum_required` for "
"details."

"Note that the command invocation must appear in the ``CMakeLists.txt`` "
"file itself; a call in an included file is not sufficient.  However, the"
"  :command:`cmake_policy` command may be called to set policy ``CMP0000``"
" to ``OLD`` or ``NEW`` behavior explicitly.  The ``OLD`` behavior is to "
"silently ignore the missing invocation.  The ``NEW`` behavior is to issue"
" an error instead of a warning.  An included file may set ``CMP0000`` "
"explicitly to affect how this policy is enforced for the main "
"``CMakeLists.txt`` file."
