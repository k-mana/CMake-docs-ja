"In CMake 2.4 and below the variable ``CMAKE_BACKWARDS_COMPATIBILITY`` was"
" used to request compatibility with earlier versions of CMake.  In CMake "
"2.6 and above all compatibility issues are handled by policies and the "
":command:`cmake_policy` command.  However, CMake must still check "
"``CMAKE_BACKWARDS_COMPATIBILITY`` for projects written for CMake 2.4 and "
"below."

"This policy was introduced in CMake version 2.6.0.  CMake version "

"Use the :command:`cmake_policy` command to set it to ``OLD`` or ``NEW`` "
"explicitly."
