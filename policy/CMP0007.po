"This policy determines whether the list command will ignore empty "
"elements in the list.  CMake 2.4 and below list commands ignored all "
"empty elements in the list.  For example, ``a;b;;c`` would have length 3 "
"and not 4.  The ``OLD`` behavior for this policy is to ignore empty list "
"elements.  The ``NEW`` behavior for this policy is to correctly count "
"empty elements in a list."
