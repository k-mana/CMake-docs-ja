msgid ""
"In CMake 2.8.0 and lower the :command:`link_directories` command passed "
"relative paths unchanged to the linker.  In CMake 2.8.1 and above the "
":command:`link_directories` command prefers to interpret relative paths "
"with respect to ``CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR``, which is consistent with "
":command:`include_directories` and other commands.  The ``OLD`` behavior "
"for this policy is to use relative paths verbatim in the linker command."
"  The ``NEW`` behavior for this policy is to convert relative paths to "
"absolute paths by appending the relative path to "
"``CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR``."

"This policy was introduced in CMake version 2.8.1.  CMake version "
"|release| warns when the policy is not set and uses ``OLD`` behavior.  "
"Use the :command:`cmake_policy` command to set it to ``OLD`` or ``NEW`` "
"explicitly."
