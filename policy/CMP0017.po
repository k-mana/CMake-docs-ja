"Starting with CMake 2.8.4, if a cmake-module shipped with CMake (i.e. "
"located in the CMake module directory) calls :command:`include` or "
":command:`find_package`, the files located in the CMake module directory "
"are preferred over the files in :variable:`CMAKE_MODULE_PATH`.  This "
"makes sure that the modules belonging to CMake always get those files "
"included which they expect, and against which they were developed and "
"tested.  In all other cases, the files found in "
":variable:`CMAKE_MODULE_PATH` still take precedence over the ones in the "
"CMake module directory.  The ``OLD`` behavior is to always prefer files "
"from CMAKE_MODULE_PATH over files from the CMake modules directory."

"This policy was introduced in CMake version 2.8.4.  CMake version "
"|release| warns when the policy is not set and uses ``OLD`` behavior.  "
"Use the :command:`cmake_policy` command to set it to ``OLD`` or ``NEW`` "
"explicitly."
