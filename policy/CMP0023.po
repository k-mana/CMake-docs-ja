"CMake 2.8.12 introduced the :command:`target_link_libraries` signature "
"using the ``PUBLIC``, ``PRIVATE``, and ``INTERFACE`` keywords to "
"generalize the ``LINK_PUBLIC`` and ``LINK_PRIVATE`` keywords introduced "
"in CMake 2.8.7. Use of signatures with any of these keywords sets the "
"link interface of a target explicitly, even if empty.  This produces "
"confusing behavior when used in combination with the historical behavior "
"of the plain :command:`target_link_libraries` signature.  For example, "
"consider the code:"

"After the first line the link interface has not been set explicitly so "
"CMake would use the link implementation, A, as the link interface. "
"However, the second line sets the link interface to empty.  In order to "
"avoid this subtle behavior CMake now prefers to disallow mixing the plain"
" and keyword signatures of :command:`target_link_libraries` for a single "
"target."
