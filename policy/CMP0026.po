msgid ""
"CMake 2.8.12 and lower allowed reading the :prop_tgt:`LOCATION` target "
"property (and configuration-specific variants) to determine the eventual "
"location of build targets.  This relies on the assumption that all "
"necessary information is available at configure-time to determine the "
"final location and filename of the target.  However, this property is not"
" fully determined until later at generate-time.  At generate time, the "
":genex:`$<TARGET_FILE>` generator expression can be used to determine the"
" eventual :prop_tgt:`LOCATION` of a target output."

"Code which reads the :prop_tgt:`LOCATION` target property can be ported "
"to use the :genex:`$<TARGET_FILE>` generator expression together with the"
" :command:`file(GENERATE)` subcommand to generate a file containing the "
"target location."
