"CMake 2.8.12 and lower allowed a signature for "
":command:`add_custom_command` which specified an input to a command.  "
"This was undocumented behavior. Modern use of CMake associates custom "
"commands with their output, rather than their input."

"The ``OLD`` behavior for this policy is to allow the use of "
":command:`add_custom_command` SOURCE signatures.  The ``NEW`` behavior "
"for this policy is to issue an error if such a signature is used."

"This policy was introduced in CMake version 3.0. CMake version |release| "
"warns when the policy is not set and uses ``OLD`` behavior.  Use the "
":command:`cmake_policy` command to set it to ``OLD`` or ``NEW`` "
"explicitly."
