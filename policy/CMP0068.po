"Previously, setting :prop_tgt:`BUILD_WITH_INSTALL_RPATH` had the effect "
"of setting both the ``install_name`` of a target to "
":prop_tgt:`INSTALL_NAME_DIR` and the ``RPATH`` to "
":prop_tgt:`INSTALL_RPATH`.  In CMake 3.9, it only affects setting of "
"``RPATH``.  However, if one wants :prop_tgt:`INSTALL_NAME_DIR` to apply "
"to the target in the build tree, one may set "
":prop_tgt:`BUILD_WITH_INSTALL_NAME_DIR`."
