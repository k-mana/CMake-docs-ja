"The existence of :module:`FindQt` means that for Qt upstream to provide "
"package config files that can be found by ``find_package(Qt)``, the "
"consuming project has to explicitly specify ``find_package(Qt CONFIG)``. "
"Removing this module gives Qt a path forward for exporting its own config"
" files which can easily be found by consuming projects."

"This policy pretends that CMake's internal :module:`FindQt` module does "
"not exist for :command:`find_package`. If a project really wants to use "
"Qt 3 or 4, it can call ``find_package(Qt[34])``, ``include(FindQt)``, or "
"add :module:`FindQt` to their :variable:`CMAKE_MODULE_PATH`."

"This policy was introduced in CMake version 3.14.  CMake version "

"explicitly."
