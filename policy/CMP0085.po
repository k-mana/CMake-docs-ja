"In CMake 3.13 and lower, the ``$<IN_LIST:...>`` generator expression "
"always returned ``0`` if the first argument was empty, even if the list "
"contained an empty item. This behavior is inconsistent with the "
"``IN_LIST`` behavior of :command:`if`, which this generator expression is"
" meant to emulate. CMake 3.14 and later handles this case correctly."

"The ``OLD`` behavior of this policy is for ``$<IN_LIST:...>`` to always "
"return ``0`` if the first argument is empty. The ``NEW`` behavior is to "

"empty item."

"This policy was introduced in CMake version 3.14.  CMake version "
