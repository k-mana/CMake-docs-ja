":module:`FindFLEX` runs ``flex`` in directory "

"The module provides a ``FLEX_TARGET`` macro which generates FLEX output. "
"In CMake 3.16 and below the macro would generate a custom command that "
"runs ``flex`` in the current source directory.  CMake 3.17 and later "
"prefer to run it in the build directory and use "
":variable:`CMAKE_CURRENT_BINARY_DIR` as the ``WORKING_DIRECTORY`` of its "
":command:`add_custom_command` invocation. This ensures that any "
"implicitly generated file is written relative to the build tree rather "
"than the source tree, unless the generated file is provided as absolute "
"path."

"The ``OLD`` behavior for this policy is for ``FLEX_TARGET`` to use the "
"current source directory for the ``WORKING_DIRECTORY`` and where to "
"generate implicit files. The ``NEW`` behavior of this policy is to use "
"the current binary directory for the ``WORKING_DIRECTORY`` relative to "
"which implicit files are generated unless provided as absolute path."

"This policy was introduced in CMake version 3.17.  Use the "
":command:`cmake_policy` command to set it to ``OLD`` or ``NEW`` "
"explicitly. Unlike many policies, CMake version |release| does *not* warn"
" when this policy is not set and simply uses ``OLD`` behavior."

"The ``OLD`` behavior of a policy is :manual:`deprecated by definition "
