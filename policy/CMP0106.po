"The :module:`Documentation` was added as a support mechanism for the VTK "
"project and was tuned for that project. Instead of CMake providing this "
"module with (now old) VTK patterns for cache variables and required "
"packages, the module is now deprecated by CMake itself."

"The ``OLD`` behavior of this policy is for :module:`Documentation` to add"

"This policy was introduced in CMake version 3.18.  CMake version "
