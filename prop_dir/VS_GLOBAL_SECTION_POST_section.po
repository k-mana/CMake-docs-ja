"The property must be set to a semicolon-separated list of ``key=value`` "

"This property only works for Visual Studio 9 and above; it is ignored on "

"Note that CMake generates postSolution sections ``ExtensibilityGlobals`` "
"and ``ExtensibilityAddIns`` by default.  If you set the corresponding "
"property, it will override the default section.  For example, setting "
"``VS_GLOBAL_SECTION_POST_ExtensibilityGlobals`` will override the default"
" contents of the ``ExtensibilityGlobals`` section, while keeping "
"ExtensibilityAddIns on its default.  However, CMake will always add a "
"``SolutionGuid`` to the ``ExtensibilityGlobals`` section if it is not "
"specified explicitly."
