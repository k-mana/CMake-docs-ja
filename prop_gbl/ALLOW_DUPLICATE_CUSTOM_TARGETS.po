"Normally CMake requires that all targets built in a project have globally"
" unique logical names (see policy :policy:`CMP0002`). This is necessary "
"to generate meaningful project file names in :generator:`Xcode` and "
":ref:`Visual Studio Generators` IDE generators.  It also allows the "
"target names to be referenced unambiguously."

"Makefile generators are capable of supporting duplicate "
":command:`add_custom_target` names.  For projects that care only about "
":ref:`Makefile Generators` and do not wish to support :generator:`Xcode` "
"or :ref:`Visual Studio Generators` IDE generators, one may set this "
"property to ``True`` to allow duplicate custom targets.  The property "
"allows multiple :command:`add_custom_target` command calls in different "
"directories to specify the same target name.  However, setting this "
"property will cause non-Makefile generators to produce an error and "
"refuse to generate the project."
