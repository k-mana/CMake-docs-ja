"CMake automatically analyzes the global inter-target dependency graph at "
"the beginning of native build system generation.  It reports an error if "
"the dependency graph contains a cycle that does not consist of all STATIC"
" library targets.  This property tells CMake to disallow all cycles "
"completely, even among static libraries."
