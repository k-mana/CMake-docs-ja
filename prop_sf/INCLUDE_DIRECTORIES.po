"Contents of ``INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES`` may use \"generator expressions\" "
"with the syntax ``$<...>``.  See the :manual:`cmake-generator-"
"expressions(7)` manual for available expressions.  However, "
":generator:`Xcode` does not support per-config per-source settings, so "
"expressions that depend on the build configuration are not allowed with "
"that generator."
