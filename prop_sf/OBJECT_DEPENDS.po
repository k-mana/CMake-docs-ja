"This property need not be used to specify the dependency of a source file"
" on a generated header file that it includes.  Although the property was "
"originally introduced for this purpose, it is no longer necessary.  If "
"the generated header file is created by a custom command in the same "
"target as the source file, the automatic dependency scanning process will"
" recognize the dependency.  If the generated header file is created by "
"another target, an inter-target dependency should be created with the "
":command:`add_dependencies` command (if one does not already exist due to"
" linking relationships)."
