"Set to a true value to ask CTest to launch the test process with CPU "
"affinity for a fixed set of processors.  If enabled and supported for the"
" current platform, CTest will choose a set of processors to place in the "
"CPU affinity mask when launching the test process.  The number of "
"processors in the set is determined by the :prop_test:`PROCESSORS` test "
"property or the number of processors available to CTest, whichever is "
"smaller.  The set of processors chosen will be disjoint from the "
"processors assigned to other concurrently running tests that also have "
"the ``PROCESSOR_AFFINITY`` property enabled."
