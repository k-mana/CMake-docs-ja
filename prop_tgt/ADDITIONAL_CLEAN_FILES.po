"A :ref:`;-list <CMake Language Lists>` of files or directories that will "
"be removed as a part of the global ``clean`` target.  It can be used to "
"specify files and directories that are generated as part of building the "
"target or that are directly associated with the target in some way (e.g. "
"created as a result of running the target)."

"For custom targets, if such files can be captured as outputs or "
"byproducts instead, then that should be preferred over adding them to "
"this property. If an additional clean file is used by multiple targets or"
" isn't target-specific, then the :prop_dir:`ADDITIONAL_CLEAN_FILES` "
"directory property may be the more appropriate property to use."
