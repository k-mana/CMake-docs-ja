"On AIX, CMake automatically exports all symbols from shared libraries, "
"and from executables with the :prop_tgt:`ENABLE_EXPORTS` target property "
"set. Explicitly disable this boolean property to suppress the behavior "
"and export no symbols by default.  In this case it is expected that the "
"project will use other means to export some symbols."
