"The ``COMPATIBLE_INTERFACE_BOOL`` property may contain a list of "
"properties for this target which must be consistent when evaluated as a "
"boolean with the ``INTERFACE`` variant of the property in all linked "
"dependees.  For example, if a property ``FOO`` appears in the list, then "
"for each dependee, the ``INTERFACE_FOO`` property content in all of its "
"dependencies must be consistent with each other, and with the ``FOO`` "
"property in the depender."

"Consistency in this sense has the meaning that if the property is set, "
"then it must have the same boolean value as all others, and if the "
"property is not set, then it is ignored."
