"The ``COMPATIBLE_INTERFACE_NUMBER_MIN`` property may contain a list of "
"properties for this target whose minimum value may be read at generate "
"time when evaluated in the ``INTERFACE`` variant of the property of all "
"linked dependees.  For example, if a property ``FOO`` appears in the "
"list, then for each dependee, the ``INTERFACE_FOO`` property content in "
"all of its dependencies will be compared with each other and with the "
"``FOO`` property in the depender. When reading the ``FOO`` property at "
"generate time, the minimum value will be returned.  If the property is "
"not set, then it is ignored."
