"If set, this will tell the required compilers to enable device linking on"
" the library target. Device linking is an additional link step required "
"by some CUDA compilers when :prop_tgt:`CUDA_SEPARABLE_COMPILATION` is "
"enabled. Normally device linking is deferred until a shared library or "
"executable is generated, allowing for multiple static libraries to "
"resolve device symbols at the same time when they are used by a shared "
"library or executable."
