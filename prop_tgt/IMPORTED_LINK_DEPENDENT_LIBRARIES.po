"Shared libraries may be linked to other shared libraries as part of their"
" implementation.  On some platforms the linker searches for the dependent"
" libraries of shared libraries they are including in the link.  Set this "
"property to the list of dependent shared libraries of an imported "
"library.  The list should be disjoint from the list of interface "
"libraries in the :prop_tgt:`INTERFACE_LINK_LIBRARIES` property.  On "
"platforms requiring dependent shared libraries to be found at link time "
"CMake uses this list to add appropriate files or paths to the link "
"command line.  Ignored for non-imported targets."
