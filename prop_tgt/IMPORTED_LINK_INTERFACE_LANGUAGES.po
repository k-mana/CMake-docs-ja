"Set this to the list of languages of source files compiled to produce a "
"``STATIC IMPORTED`` library (such as ``C`` or ``CXX``).  CMake accounts "
"for these languages when computing how to link a target to the imported "
"library.  For example, when a C executable links to an imported C++ "
"static library CMake chooses the C++ linker to satisfy language runtime "
"dependencies of the static library."
