"Do not use this ``<CONFIG>``-specific property if you need to use Xcode "
"variables like ``$(CURRENT_ARCH)`` or ``$(EFFECTIVE_PLATFORM_NAME)`` in "
"the value.  The ``<CONFIG>``-specific properties will be ignored in such "
"cases because CMake cannot determine whether a file exists at the "
"configuration-specific path at configuration time.  For such cases, use "
":prop_tgt:`IMPORTED_OBJECTS` instead."
