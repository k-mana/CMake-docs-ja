"Targets may populate this property to publish the include directories "
"which contain system headers, and therefore should not result in compiler"
" warnings.  The :command:`target_include_directories(SYSTEM)` command "
"signature populates this property with values given to the ``PUBLIC`` and"
" ``INTERFACE`` keywords."

"Projects may also get and set the property directly, but must be aware "
"that adding directories to this property does not make those directories "
"used during compilation.  Adding directories to this property marks "
"directories as ``SYSTEM`` which otherwise would be used in a "
"non-``SYSTEM`` manner.  This can appear similar to 'duplication', so "
"prefer the high-level :command:`target_include_directories(SYSTEM)` "
"command and avoid setting the property by low-level means."

"When target dependencies are specified using "
":command:`target_link_libraries`, CMake will read this property from all "

"system headers."
