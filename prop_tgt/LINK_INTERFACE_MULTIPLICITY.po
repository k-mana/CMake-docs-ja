"When linking to a ``STATIC`` library target with cyclic dependencies the "
"linker may need to scan more than once through the archives in the "
"strongly connected component of the dependency graph.  CMake by default "
"constructs the link line so that the linker will scan through the "
"component at least twice.  This property specifies the minimum number of "
"scans if it is larger than the default.  CMake uses the largest value "
"specified by any target in a component."
