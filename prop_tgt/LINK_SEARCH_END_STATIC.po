"Some linkers support switches such as ``-Bstatic`` and ``-Bdynamic`` to "
"determine whether to use static or shared libraries for ``-lXXX`` "
"options. CMake uses these options to set the link type for libraries "
"whose full paths are not known or (in some cases) are in implicit link "
"directories for the platform.  By default CMake adds an option at the end"
" of the library list (if necessary) to set the linker search type back to"
" its starting type.  This property switches the final linker search type "
"to ``-Bstatic`` regardless of how it started."
