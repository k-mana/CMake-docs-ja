"This is a boolean option that when set to ``TRUE`` will automatically run"
" ``ldd -r -u`` on the target after it is linked. In addition, the linker "
"flag ``-Wl,--no-as-needed`` will be passed to the target with the link "
"command so that all libraries specified on the command line will be "
"linked into the target. This will result in the link producing a list of "
"libraries that provide no symbols used by this target but are being "
"linked to it. This is only applicable to executable and shared library "
"targets and will only work when ld and ldd accept the flags used."
