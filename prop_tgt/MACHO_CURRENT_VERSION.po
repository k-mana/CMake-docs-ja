"For shared libraries on Mach-O systems (e.g. macOS, iOS) the "
":prop_tgt:`MACHO_COMPATIBILITY_VERSION` property corresponds to the "
"*compatibility version* and ``MACHO_CURRENT_VERSION`` corresponds to the "
"*current version*.  These are both embedded in the shared library binary "
"and can be checked with the ``otool -L <binary>`` command."

"It should be noted that the ``MACHO_CURRENT_VERSION`` and "
":prop_tgt:`MACHO_COMPATIBILITY_VERSION` properties do not affect the file"
" names or version-related symlinks that CMake generates for the library. "
"The :prop_tgt:`VERSION` and :prop_tgt:`SOVERSION` target properties still"
" control the file and symlink names.  The ``install_name`` is also still "
"controlled by :prop_tgt:`SOVERSION`."

"When ``MACHO_CURRENT_VERSION`` and "
":prop_tgt:`MACHO_COMPATIBILITY_VERSION` are not given, "
":prop_tgt:`VERSION` and :prop_tgt:`SOVERSION` are used for the version "
"details to be embedded in the binaries respectively. The "
"``MACHO_CURRENT_VERSION`` and :prop_tgt:`MACHO_COMPATIBILITY_VERSION` "
"properties only need to be given if the project needs to decouple the "
"file and symlink naming from the version details embedded in the binaries"
" (e.g. to match libtool conventions)."
