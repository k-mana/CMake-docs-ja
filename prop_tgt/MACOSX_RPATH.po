"When this property is set to ``TRUE``, the directory portion of the "
"``install_name`` field of this shared library will be ``@rpath`` unless "
"overridden by :prop_tgt:`INSTALL_NAME_DIR`.  This indicates the shared "

"Policy :policy:`CMP0042` was introduced to change the default value of "
"``MACOSX_RPATH`` to ``TRUE``.  This is because use of ``@rpath`` is a "
"more flexible and powerful alternative to ``@executable_path`` and "
"``@loader_path``."
