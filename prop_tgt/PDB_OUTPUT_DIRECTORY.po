"This property specifies the directory into which the MS debug symbols "
"will be placed by the linker. The property value may use "
":manual:`generator expressions <cmake-generator-expressions(7)>`. Multi-"
"configuration generators append a per-configuration subdirectory to the "
"specified directory unless a generator expression is used."

"property to specify the latter."
