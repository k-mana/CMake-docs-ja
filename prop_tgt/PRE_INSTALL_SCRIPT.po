"The ``PRE_INSTALL_SCRIPT`` and :prop_tgt:`POST_INSTALL_SCRIPT` properties"
" are the old way to specify CMake scripts to run before and after "
"installing a target.  They are used only when the old ``INSTALL_TARGETS``"
" command is used to install the target.  Use the :command:`install` "
"command instead."
