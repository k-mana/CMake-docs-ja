"One known use case for this identifier is to disambiguate the variables "
"in an anonymous namespace in a limited scope. Anonymous namespaces "
"present a problem for unity builds because they are used to ensure that "
"certain variables and declarations are scoped to a translation unit which"
" is approximated by a single source file.  When source files are combined"
" in a unity build file, those variables in different files are combined "
"in a single translation unit and the names clash.  This property can be "
"used to avoid that with code like the following:"

"The pseudononymous namespace is used within a truly anonymous namespace. "
"On many platforms, this maintains the invariant that the symbols within "
"do not get external linkage when performing a unity build."
