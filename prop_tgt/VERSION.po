"For shared libraries ``VERSION`` and :prop_tgt:`SOVERSION` can be used to"
" specify the build version and API version respectively.  When building "
"or installing appropriate symlinks are created if the platform supports "
"symlinks and the linker supports so-names.  If only one of both is "
"specified the missing is assumed to have the same version number.  For "
"executables ``VERSION`` can be used to specify the build version.  When "
"building or installing appropriate symlinks are created if the platform "

"Mach-O specific overrides are provided, as discussed below). See the "
