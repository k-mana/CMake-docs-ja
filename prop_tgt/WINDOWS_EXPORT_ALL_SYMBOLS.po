"Enable this boolean property to automatically create a module definition "
"(``.def``) file with all global symbols found in the input ``.obj`` files"
" for a ``SHARED`` library (or executable with :prop_tgt:`ENABLE_EXPORTS`)"
" on Windows.  The module definition file will be passed to the linker "
"causing all symbols to be exported from the ``.dll``. For global *data* "
"symbols, ``__declspec(dllimport)`` must still be used when compiling "
"against the code in the ``.dll``.  All other function symbols will be "
"automatically exported and imported by callers.  This simplifies porting "
"projects to Windows by reducing the need for explicit ``dllexport`` "
"markup, even in ``C++`` classes."

"When this property is enabled, zero or more ``.def`` files may also be "
"specified as source files of the target.  The exports named by these "
"files will be merged with those detected from the object files to "
"generate a single module definition file to be passed to the linker.  "
"This can be used to export symbols from a ``.dll`` that are not in any of"
" its object files but are added by the linker from dependencies (e.g. "
"``msvcrt.lib``)."
