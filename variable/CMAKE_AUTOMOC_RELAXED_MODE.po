"By default, :prop_tgt:`AUTOMOC` behaves exactly as described in the "
"documentation of the :prop_tgt:`AUTOMOC` target property.  When set to "
"``TRUE``, it accepts more input and tries to find the correct input file "
"for ``moc`` even if it differs from the documented behaviour.  In this "
"mode it e.g.  also checks whether a header file is intended to be "
"processed by moc when a ``\"foo.moc\"`` file has been included."
