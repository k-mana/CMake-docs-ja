"For native build systems supporting multiple configurations in the build "
"tree (such as :ref:`Visual Studio Generators` and :generator:`Xcode`), "
"the value is a reference to a build-time variable specifying the name of "
"the per-configuration output subdirectory.  On :ref:`Makefile Generators`"
" this evaluates to `.` because there is only one configuration in a build"
" tree. Example values:"

"Note that this variable only has limited support on :generator:`Ninja "
"Multi-Config`. It is recommended that you use the ``$<CONFIG>`` "
":manual:`generator expression <cmake-generator-expressions(7)>` instead."

"Since these values are evaluated by the native build system, this "

"Note that ``CMAKE_CFG_INTDIR`` is no longer necessary for this purpose "
"but has been left for compatibility with existing projects.  Instead "
":command:`add_custom_command` recognizes executable target names in its "
"``COMMAND`` option, so "
"``${CMAKE_CURRENT_BINARY_DIR}/${CMAKE_CFG_INTDIR}/mytool`` can be "
"replaced by just ``mytool``."

"This variable is read-only.  Setting it is undefined behavior.  In multi-"
"configuration build systems the value of this variable is passed as the "
"value of preprocessor symbol ``CMAKE_INTDIR`` to the compilation of all "
"source files."
