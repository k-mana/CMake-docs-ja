"It is quite common practice in CMake for modules to use some additional "
"files, such as templates to be copied in after substituting CMake "
"variables. In such cases, a function needs to know where to locate those "
"files in a way that doesn't depend on where the function is called.  "
"Without ``CMAKE_CURRENT_FUNCTION_LIST_DIR``, the code to do that would "
"typically use the following pattern:"

"Using ``CMAKE_CURRENT_FUNCTION_LIST_DIR`` inside the function instead "
"eliminates the need for the extra variable which would otherwise be "
"visible outside the function's scope. The above example can be written in"
" the more concise and more robust form:"
