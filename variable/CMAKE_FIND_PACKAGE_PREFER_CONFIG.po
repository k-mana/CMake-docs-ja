"The command :command:`find_package` operates without an explicit mode "
"when the reduced signature is used without the ``MODULE`` option. In this"
" case, by default, CMake first tries Module mode by searching for a "
"``Find<pkg>.cmake`` module.  If it fails, CMake then searches for the "
"package using Config mode."

"This variable may be useful when a developer has compiled a custom "
"version of a common library and wishes to link it to a dependent project."
"  If this variable is set to ``TRUE``, it would prevent a dependent "
"project's call to :command:`find_package` from selecting the default "
"library located by the system's ``Find<pkg>.cmake`` module before finding"
" the developer's custom built library."

"Once this variable is set, it is the responsibility of the exported "
"``<pkg>Config.cmake`` files to provide the same result variables as the "
"``Find<pkg>.cmake`` modules so that dependent projects can use them "
"interchangeably."
