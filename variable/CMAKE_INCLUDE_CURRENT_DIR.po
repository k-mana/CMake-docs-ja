"If this variable is enabled, CMake automatically adds "
":variable:`CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR` and "
":variable:`CMAKE_CURRENT_BINARY_DIR` to the include path for each "
"directory.  These additional include directories do not propagate down to"
" subdirectories.  This is useful mainly for out-of-source builds, where "
"files generated into the build tree are included by files located in the "
"source tree."
