"This variable is an alternative to providing the ``--log-context`` option"
" on the :manual:`cmake <cmake(1)>` command line.  Whereas the command "
"line option will apply only to that one CMake run, setting "
"``CMAKE_MESSAGE_CONTEXT_SHOW`` to true as a cache variable will ensure "
"that subsequent CMake runs will continue to show the message context."

"Projects should not set ``CMAKE_MESSAGE_CONTEXT_SHOW``.  It is intended "
