"By default, the ``install`` target depends on the ``all`` target.  This "
"has the effect, that when ``make install`` is invoked or ``INSTALL`` is "
"built, first the ``all`` target is built, then the installation starts. "
"If :variable:`CMAKE_SKIP_INSTALL_ALL_DEPENDENCY` is set to ``TRUE``, this"
" dependency is not created, so the installation process will start "
"immediately, independent from whether the project has been completely "
"built or not."
