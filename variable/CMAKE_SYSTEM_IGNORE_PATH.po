":ref:`Semicolon-separated list <CMake Language Lists>` of directories to "
"be *ignored* by the :command:`find_program`, :command:`find_library`, "
":command:`find_file`, and :command:`find_path` commands.  This is useful "
"in cross-compiling environments where some system directories contain "
"incompatible but possibly linkable libraries.  For example, on cross-"
"compiled cluster environments, this allows a user to ignore directories "
"containing libraries meant for the front-end machine."
