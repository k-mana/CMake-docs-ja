"The :ref:`Visual Studio Generators` for VS 2010 and above support using a"
" standalone (non-installed) NVIDIA CUDA toolkit.  The path may be "
"specified by a field in :variable:`CMAKE_GENERATOR_TOOLSET` of the form "
"``cuda=C:\\path\\to\\cuda``.  The given directory must at least contain a"
" folder ``.\\nvcc`` and must provide Visual Studio integration files in "
"path ``.\\CUDAVisualStudioIntegration\\extras\\ "
"visual_studio_integration\\MSBuildExtensions\\``. One can create a "
"standalone CUDA toolkit directory by either opening a installer with 7zip"
" or copying the files that are extracted by the running installer. The "
"value may be empty if no path to a standalone CUDA Toolkit was specified."
