"``DESTDIR`` means DESTination DIRectory.  It is commonly used by makefile"
" users in order to install software at non-default location.  It is a "
"basic relocation mechanism that should not be used on Windows (see "
":variable:`CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX` documentation).  It is usually invoked "
"like this:"

"which will install the concerned software using the installation prefix, "
"e.g. ``/usr/local`` prepended with the ``DESTDIR`` value which finally "
"gives ``/home/john/usr/local``.  When preparing a package, CPack first "
"installs the items to be packaged in a local (to the build tree) "
"directory by using the same ``DESTDIR`` mechanism.  Nevertheless, if "
"``CPACK_SET_DESTDIR`` is set then CPack will set ``DESTDIR`` before doing"
" the local install.  The most noticeable difference is that without "
"``CPACK_SET_DESTDIR``, CPack uses "
":variable:`CPACK_PACKAGING_INSTALL_PREFIX` as a prefix whereas with "
"``CPACK_SET_DESTDIR`` set, CPack will use "
":variable:`CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX` as a prefix."

"Manually setting ``CPACK_SET_DESTDIR`` may help (or simply be necessary) "
"if some install rules uses absolute ``DESTINATION`` (see CMake "
":command:`install` command).  However, starting with CPack/CMake 2.8.3 "
"RPM and DEB installers tries to handle ``DESTDIR`` automatically so that "
"it is seldom necessary for the user to set it."
