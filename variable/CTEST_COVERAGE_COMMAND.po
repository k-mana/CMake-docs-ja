"The Cobertura Coverage parser expects to read the coverage data from a "
"single XML file which contains the coverage data for all modules. "
"Cobertura has a program with the ability to merge given ``cobertura.ser``"
" files and then another program to generate a combined XML file from the "
"previous merged file.  For command line testing, this can be done by hand"
" prior to CTest looking for the coverage files. For script builds, set "
"the ``CTEST_COVERAGE_COMMAND`` variable to point to a file which will "
"perform these same steps, such as a ``.sh`` or ``.bat`` file."
